## Gallery

- The gallery contains images of dogs, some of dogs getting a haircut, some of dogs getting a bath and some of beautiful groomed dogs. 
- Some of the images have a pink background and some have blue details. And this is used to make a pattern and make the gallery more alive. 
- The gallery have the same header and footer as the homepage and the images have the same background color as the first and second section on homepage to make the website coherent. 
- One thing that I would like to fix in the future is to make the gallery look better on different screen sizes. Because I don't think the order of the pictures looks so good on smaller screens. But it is good enough for now.

## Book now 

- The book now page has a form for the customers to fill in and book a grooming for their dog. 
- The form collects the dog owners firstname, lastname, email and what weekday and time the owner will book. 
- The book now page have the same style as the rest of the website, and the header and footer is of course the same as the rest of the pages on this website.

## Testing
- I tested this website in different browsers: Safari, Crome and Firefox.
- I confirmed that this website looks good on different screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar. 
- I confirmed that this websites navigation, header, sections, gallery and book now page are readable and easy to understand.  
- I have confirmed that the form works on book now page: requiers entries in every field, will only accept email in email field and the submition button works. 

### Bugs
- An bug that I am aware of is that when the user fill in the form and click the "Book now!" button, an error messege will apear "405 Not Allowed". 

### Validator Testing

#### HTML
- Errors returned when passed through the official W3C validator was Error duplicate ID for fname, lname and email.  
- Deleted the id:s for fname, lname and email in label element in booknow.html page to fix the error. 
- After that no errors were found by the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ffrida010.github.io%2Fhttps-github.com-Frida010-Project-01%2F). 
- However, there is a warning message from the validator about missing headings on the homepage. 

#### CSS
- Errors returned when passing trough the official (Jigsaw) validator was "_Value Error : float center is not a float value : center_" for #services, #address, #contact and #about
- Deleted the float center value in the style.css. 
- After that no errors were returned when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2F8000-frida010-https-githubco-u98cxrzf2k.us2.codeanyapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

#### Accessibility
- I confirmed that the fonts and colors used on the website are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.

### Unfixed bugs

- I have one unfixed bug on this website and that is the one I mentioned earlier in this README file. _"An bug that I am aware of is that when the user fill in the form and click the "Book now!" button, an error messege will apear "405 Not Allowed"."_
- I chose not to fix that bug because Pawesome Gromming doesn't exist as an physical location/business and therefore there is no reason to book an appointment. And because I don't have the knowledge yet to be able to make it work. But maybe in the future when I know how to do that type of code I will fix that problem. 

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page provided the link to the completed website.
